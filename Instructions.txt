 Makeshift GroupMe stats program.

Please pass this down to some other nerds before you leave.
I'm sure someday someone will have a better way of doing this, but it might be fun to keep the same file going.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------

1. Go to https://dev.groupme.com/ and get an access Token

2. Run archive_chat.py to download the GroupMe:

    - you will have to run it with access token and a group ID as arguments

        E.g. run the following line for the Main chat:
        archive_chat.py --token [paste your access token here and delete the brackets] --group-chat-id 30827774
        
        Running it without a group id will give you a menu listing id's for all of the chats connected to your account

    - This part takes a while and will sometimes quit halfway through. Just run it a few times until it works.

    - I have commented out sections that download all of the profile avatars and attachments in the chat, you can
    un-comment those, but it takes a couple of hours to download and the attachements file is a few Gigabytes. 

3. Run analysis.py
   
    - You will need to update the file paths in analysis.py to match the folder created by archive_chat.py:

        update the message_path variable to "[chat name]/messages.json"
        update the people_path variable to "[chat name]/people.json"

4. Open analysis.csv in Excel and sort based on the different columns

    - If you are feeling gutsy you can edit the code to sort it before it exports the csv, but I was too lazy.
